## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This application was built with a focus on modern, stable, and scalable technologies, following industry best practices.

*   **Language:** **Kotlin** (100%)
*   **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and a testable codebase.
*   **UI:** Built with **XML Layouts** and **ViewBinding** for type-safe view access.
*   **Navigation:** A modern **ViewPager2** implementation synchronized with a **BottomNavigationView** for a fluid, up-to-date user experience.
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** **Kotlin Coroutines** and **Flow** for managing background tasks and handling data streams from Firebase.
*   **Cloud Database:** **Firebase Realtime Database** for real-time data storage and synchronization.
*   **Authentication:** **Firebase Authentication** for secure email/password login.
*   **Dependency Management:** A shared **ViewModel (`MainViewModel`)** scoped to the Activity provides a single source of truth for the fragments, simplifying state management.
